# Hands-On 1 (HO1)

Before beginning, make sure your environment is properly set up.
This was documented in Hands-On 0: https://github.com/ucsc-cse-40/HO0

In this assignment, you will pre-process and analyze synthetic data (i.e., data produced by an algorithm rather than collected from the real world).

The objective of this assignment is for you to learn about:
 - Data manipulation (selecting, adding, removing rows and columns).
 - Data exploration (understanding the structure and contents of a dataset).
 - Data selection (filtering rows and columns).
 - Feature engineering (pre-processing data for use with machine learning).
 - Basic data visualization (plotting data to explore functional relationships between variables).

## Submitting the Assignment

Submit your assignment by running `python3 -m autograder.cli.submit assignment.ipynb` from your local repository directory.
This script will check for your cruzid, password, and assignment id in `config.json`
and submit your work to a server controlled by the TAs where tests will be run, reporting the results back to you.
