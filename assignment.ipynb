    "In this assignment, you will pre-process and analyze synthetic data (i.e., data produced by an algorithm rather than collected from the real world).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this assignment is for you to learn about:\n",
    " - Data manipulation (selecting, adding, and removing rows and columns).\n",
    " - Data exploration (understanding the structure and contents of a dataset).\n",
    " - Data selection (filtering rows and columns).\n",
    " - Feature engineering (pre-processing data for use with machine learning).\n",
    " - Basic data visualization (e.g., plotting data to explore functional relationships between variables).\n",
    " - Working with mathematical equations and turning them into code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, we will be using the [Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to manipulate data.\n",
    "This library is very large and can be quite complex,\n",
    "but we will cover the basics of Pandas in this lesson.\n",
    "If you want additional information or practice,\n",
    "we recommend the official [Pandas Tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html).\n",

    "### Useful Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame class has **MANY** [methods associated with it](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).\n",
    "Throughout this course, make sure to consult the documentation before implementing new functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few methods that you may find useful in this and future assignments:\n",
    " - Number of Rows -- You can use the builtin function `len()` on a frame the same way that you can use it on a list or dict.\n",
    "     You can also use [DataFrame.count()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.count.html).\n",
    " - Column Names -- You can get the available column names using [DataFrame.columns](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.columns.html).\n",
    " - Basic Frame Info -- [DataFrame.info()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.info.html) can be used to output basic information about the structure of the frame.\n",
    " - Numeric Aggregates -- The DataFrame class has\n",
    "     [sum()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sum.html),\n",
    "     [min()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.min.html),\n",
    "     [max()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.max.html),\n",
    "     [median()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.median.html),\n",
    "     and [mean()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.mean.html) methods.\n",
    " - Plotting Functions -- The DataFrame class has premade methods for plotting (using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)).\n",
    "     For example, [DataFrame.hist()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.hist.html) can be used to make a histogram\n",
    "     and [DataFrame.plot.scatter()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.scatter.html) can be used to make a scatter plot.\n",
    "     These methods are not as full-features as using matplotlib directly, but they can give you a fast and simple way to visualize a frame.\n",
    "     For more information, see [this reference](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html).\n",

    "we can evaluate how good our predictions are.\n",
    "To evaluate our function's performance, we can use [evaluation metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_of_binary_classifiers#Single_metrics),\n",
    "which are numbers that quantify predictive performance (how well our predictions match reality).\n",
    "There are [dozens of evaluation metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html),\n",
    "but for this example we will use [root mean square error (RMSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) (also sometimes called root mean square deviation (RMSD)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for RMSE is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sqrt{  \\frac{  \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} ( \\hat{y}_i - y_i )^2 }{ N } }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation may look intimidating, but let's break the equation down piece-by-piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we see a big square root covering everything.\n",
    "We already know how to use a square root, so let's put that aside for now and simplify the equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{  \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} ( \\hat{y}_i - y_i )^2 }{ N }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we see a fraction with a summation in the numerator and a single variable ($ N $) as the denominator.\n",
    "Note that the summation goes from $ i = 1 $ to $ N $, so it is adding up $ N $ different values.\n",
    "Since we are adding up $ N $ values and $ N $ is also the denominator,\n",
    "this fraction looks like it is computing the mean of whatever the summation is adding up.\n",
    "Since we also know how to compute a mean, let's put that part aside and focus on the summation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} ( \\hat{y}_i - y_i )^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The summation is using $ i $ as its incrementing variable and is going from $ 1 $ to $ N $.\n",
    "We can also see that the value inside the summation is squared.\n",
    "We can easily deal with squaring values, so let's simplify again:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y}_i - y_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are finally left with a simple expression, but we have to make sure we understand what these two values represent.\n",
    "In machine learning equations (as you have already seen in class),\n",
    "we represent labels/classes with the letter $ y $.\n",
    "By itself $ y $ usually represents a true label,\n",
    "and with a hat $ \\hat{y} $ usually represents a predicted label.\n",
    "Therefore, our expression ($ \\hat{y}_i - y_i $) is taking the difference between the predicted label ($ \\hat{y} $) and the true label ($ y $) for the ith data point.\n",
    "We often call this (the difference between true and predicted values) the *error* of a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to summarize what we discovered starting from the inner-most part of the equation and working out:\n",
    " - First, the equation computes the **error** for each prediction.\n",
    " - Then, the **square** of that error is computed.\n",
    " - The **mean** of all those squared errors is computed using the summation and division.\n",
    " - Then finally, the equation takes the square **root** of that mean.\n",
    "When we phrase it like this,\n",
    "you can see why this metric is called \"root mean square error\".\n",
    "\n",
    "By breaking up this equation into smaller chunks,\n",
    "we were able to understand each part individually and then put them all back together into the full equation.\n",
    "And now that we understand the equation, we can implement it in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tips to use when translating equations into code:\n",
    " - Look for summations, these usually indicate loops.\n",
    " - Tend to start with the inside of the equation, since the outer parts of an equation are evaluated last.\n",
    " - Don't be afraid to break up your implementation using more code functions (just like how some equations call into other equations/functions).\n",
    " - Be careful about order of operations.\n",
    " - Even though equations will usually use short variable names, longer and more descriptive names can be more useful in code (e.g. using `predicted_label` is more readable than `y_hat`)."
